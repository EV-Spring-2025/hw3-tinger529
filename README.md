# EV-HW3: PhysGaussian

This homework is based on the recent CVPR 2024 paper [PhysGaussian](https://github.com/XPandora/PhysGaussian/tree/main), which introduces a novel framework that integrates physical constraints into 3D Gaussian representations for modeling generative dynamics.

You are **not required** to implement training from scratch. Instead, your task is to set up the environment as specified in the official repository and run the simulation scripts to observe and analyze the results.


## Getting the Code from the Official PhysGaussian GitHub Repository
Download the official codebase using the following command:
```
git clone https://github.com/XPandora/PhysGaussian.git
```


## Environment Setup
Navigate to the "PhysGaussian" directory and follow the instructions under the "Python Environment" section in the official README to set up the environment.


## Running the Simulation
Follow the "Quick Start" section and execute the simulation scripts as instructed. Make sure to verify your outputs and understand the role of physics constraints in the generated dynamics.


## Homework Instructions
Please complete Part 1â€“2 as described in the [Google Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/13JcQC12pI8Wb9ZuaVV400HVZr9eUeZvf7gB7Le8FRV4/edit?usp=sharing).

# Report

## Part 1 Video

Please check part1/ directory.

## Part 2

**PSNR**

| Adjustment | PSNR (dB) |
| ---------- | ---- |
| grid_v_damping_scale 0.9999 -> 1.9999| 20.01 |
| substep_dt 1e-4 -> 6e-5 | 22.61 |

**Observation**

1. Increasing grid_v_damping_scale make the tree accelerate more than before.
2. Decreasing substep_dt

**Video Link**

**Bonus**

Design a machine learning model that input a video of a specific object, predict the parameters of the object. We can use some known object as ground truth to train the model.

We can also use some well defined physics simulater parameters as model input, so it is easier to learn the relation between physics parameters and model parameters.
